# Serverless twitter bot

Twitter bot powered by [Serverless](https://serverless.com) and hosted in [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) that search ethereum related repositories using the [Github search api](https://developer.github.com/v3/search), and tweets about them on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.

You can find the Twitter bot [@bot_ether](https://twitter.com/bot_ether).

## Configuration

To configure the twitter credentials you need to create a `env.yml` file like this:

``` yml
dev:
  NODE_ENV: 'development'
prod:
  CONSUMER_KEY: 'Twitter consumer key'
  CONSUMER_SECRET: 'Twitter consumer secret'
  ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY: 'Twitter access token key'
  ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: 'Twitter access token secret'
  NODE_ENV: 'production'
```

## Running locally

To run a function locally:

`serverless invoke local -f (daily|weekly|monthly) -s (dev|prod)`

If `NODE_ENV` is set as `development` on `env.yml` the bot won't publish the tweet. To override this you need to add your twitter credentials and set the `NODE_ENV` to something like `production` on your stage configuration in `env.yml`.

## Deployment

The serverless functions are configured to be deployed to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), so you need to [configure your credentials](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/) and then deploy:

`serverless deploy -s (dev|prod)`
